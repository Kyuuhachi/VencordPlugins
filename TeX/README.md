# TeX

Renders TeX formulas.
`` `$\sin x$` `` renders as $\sin x$,
`` `$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$` `` renders as $\displaystyle x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
The latter is intentionally set to an inline-block instead of a block, to save space.

This plugin requires external libraries, which will not work in the userscript version of Vencord without additional workarounds.
